<section class="policy-section">
    <h2>1. Digital Products & Learning Materials</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the digital nature of our courses, downloadable resources,
        templates, and AI-powered systems, all sales of learning materials
        and digital products are final.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once access has been granted or files have been downloaded,
        refunds will not be issued. This policy protects the integrity
        of our intellectual property and digital assets.
